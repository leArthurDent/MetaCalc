# MetaCalc
Calculator for monoisotopic masses of metabolites

MetaCalc is a command line tool for calculating common (not individual!) metabolite masses and molecular formulas from a parent compound. This might be usefull for metabolism studies using high resolution mass spectrometry where you need to search through ion chromatogramms by molecular masses of the metabolites you propose.
Therefore its helpfull to have a basic set of masses at hand without the need to draw each metabolite with 2D drawing software and subsequently generate the monoisotopic mass.

Planned features for future versions:
- Create a GUI based on GTK+
- Include derivatisations of the parent compound into calculation
- Advanced chemistry considerations like esters, amides, cyclic structures, ...
- Include ESI, APCI and EI ion source
- calculations of metabolites on the basis of 2D structure files like MDL mol files and such
